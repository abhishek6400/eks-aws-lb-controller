## ðŸ“– Project Description

This project provides a complete step-by-step guide to install and configure the **AWS Load Balancer Controller** on an **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** cluster using **only CLI tools** â€” no UI console needed.

It covers:

- âœ… Creating an EKS cluster using `eksctl`
- âœ… Setting up IAM policies and service accounts
- âœ… Installing the AWS Load Balancer Controller via `Helm`
- âœ… Verifying that the controller is running correctly

This setup allows Kubernetes services (like Ingress) on EKS to use **AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs)** for high availability and auto-scaling.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Who is this for?

- DevOps beginners learning AWS EKS
- Engineers preparing for real-world Kubernetes setup
- Anyone looking to automate ALB setup on Kubernetes

---

By the end of this project, you'll have a working EKS cluster with load balancing integrated via AWS ALB â€” **production-ready and cloud-native**.
